    You should create a Cycle detection algorithm, that takes a graph as input and as output it returns a cycle in the graph (list of vertices) or null, if there is no cycles in the graph.

    You should create an algorithm that takes a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and returns the vertices in a topologically sorted order.

    You should create an algorithm, that finds a minimum spanning tree for a given graph.

Handin is the 19. of may. Handin should be made as a pull request on this repository.
